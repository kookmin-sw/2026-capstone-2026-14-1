# FitPlus Agent Guide

## Overview

FitPlus is a webcam-based workout coaching web app.

- Backend: Node.js, Express, EJS
- Frontend: Vanilla JS, CSS
- Realtime pose analysis: MediaPipe Pose in the browser
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

The browser performs pose inference, rep counting, scoring, and feedback generation. The server renders pages, manages auth, and stores workout/routine/history data.

## Runbook

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start app: `node app.js`
- Run tests: `npm test`

Required environment variables live in `.env`.

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`
- `PORT`

## Key Paths

- App entry: `app.js`
- Main routes: `routes/`
- Controllers: `controllers/`
- Views: `views/`
- Public assets: `public/`
- Workout runtime: `public/js/workout/`
- Tests: `test/`
- Specs and plans: `docs/` and `docs/superpowers/`

## Workout Runtime Map

- Session orchestration: `public/js/workout/session-controller.js`
- Camera and overlay sync: `public/js/workout/session-camera.js`
- Pose-derived metrics: `public/js/workout/pose-engine.js`
- Rule evaluation and gating: `public/js/workout/scoring-engine.js`
- Rep state handling: `public/js/workout/rep-counter.js`
- Exercise rules:
  - `public/js/workout/exercises/squat-exercise.js`
  - `public/js/workout/exercises/push-up-exercise.js`
  - `public/js/workout/exercises/plank-exercise.js`

## Working Rules

- Prefer existing runtime authority boundaries.
- Keep exercise-specific rules inside each exercise module.
- Keep shared gating and generic metric handling in `scoring-engine.js`.

### Serena MCP

Use **Serena** when semantics and structure matter (not for every task — unnecessary calls waste time and tokens):

- **Prefer Serena for:** symbol lookup; find references across files; assessing impact before changing workout logic, controllers, or data flow; refactors that must stay consistent (rename-safe paths, replace/insert at symbol boundaries).
- **Exploration workflow:** start with `get_symbols_overview`, then narrow with `find_symbol` / reference tools — avoid reading whole files unless needed.
- **Prefer `rg`, IDE search, or normal file edits for:** literal strings (errors, logs, copy), comments, TODOs, config values, and other pattern-only searches; tiny one-line text tweaks with no cross-file symbol concern.
- **Fallback:** if symbol tools are unclear (unknown names, string-heavy JS), use shell/`rg` to locate candidates, then use Serena on the relevant paths.

- When changing pose-derived inputs, update both runtime code and tests.
- Do not assume the git worktree is clean.
- Do not overwrite unrelated user changes.

## Validation Expectations

For workout logic changes, check at least these areas:

- Quality gate behavior
- Exercise-specific scoring behavior
- Session UI state integration
- Regression coverage in `test/workout/`

Prefer targeted tests first, then run the full suite with `npm test`.
